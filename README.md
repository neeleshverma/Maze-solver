# Maze-solver
Implemented Value iteration policy to get the optimal value function and optimal policy for each state and use this to get the shortest path in a maze

At each state, we can have a deterministic move, where we always take the correct move. This is a **deterministic maze**.

At each state, we can also have make a correct move with probability p and a random move with probability (1-p). This is called **stochastic maze**.
